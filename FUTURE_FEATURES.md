# Future Features & AI-Powered Enhancements Roadmap

This document defines a long-term, extensible roadmap for evolving the Java Learning Platform into a **deeply interactive, AI-powered, career-focused learning ecosystem**.

The roadmap focuses on three pillars:

- **Deep Interactivity** – learning by doing, not reading
- **Real-World Skills** – alignment with industry expectations
- **Platform Maturity** – scalability, accessibility, and maintainability

## 1. Core Technology Upgrades

### 🚀 Real-Time Code Execution (The "Magic" Upgrade)

**Current State**  
The existing code playground simulates execution without running real Java code.

**Vision**  
Enable learners to write and execute *real* Java code in a secure, sandboxed environment and receive authentic compiler errors, runtime output, and stack traces.

**Key Capabilities**
- Compile and execute arbitrary Java code
- Capture stdout, stderr, and exit codes
- Display compiler diagnostics inline
- Support multiple files and packages (future phase)

**Implementation Options**
- Third-party APIs: Piston, Judge0
- Custom microservice:
  - Spring Boot execution service
  - Docker-based sandboxing
  - CPU, memory, and time limits
  - Network isolation

**Security Considerations**
- Resource quotas
- Execution timeouts
- Read-only file systems
- Container recycling

**Impact**
Transforms the platform from a tutorial/reference site into a true **IDE in the browser**, dramatically increasing credibility and retention.

### 🔐 User Authentication & Cloud Sync

**Current State**  
Progress is stored in `localStorage`, making it fragile and device-specific.

**Vision**  
Provide persistent, secure, cross-device user accounts with progress tracking and personalization.

**Features**
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
- Email/password fallback
- Cross-device progress sync
- Saved playground code
- Bookmarks and favorites

**Implementation**
- Auth providers: Clerk, Auth0, Supabase
- JWT-based session management
- Backend user profile service

**Enables**
- Leaderboards
- Streak tracking
- Certifications
- Community features

**Impact**
Lays the foundation for all social, competitive, and long-term learning features.

## 2. Content Expansion: "Zero to Hero"

### ☕ Phase 3: Enterprise Java (Spring Boot)

**Goal**  
Bridge the gap between academic Java and professional Java development.

#### Module 11: Dependency Injection (Spring Core)

- Constructor vs field injection
- Circular dependency simulation

#### Module 12: REST APIs
- Controller → Service → Repository flow
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE lifecycle
- HTTP status codes explained visually
- Request/response payload inspection

#### Module 13: Databases (JPA / Hibernate)
- Entity-to-table mapping
- Lazy vs eager loading
- SQL generated by ORM
- N+1 query problem visualization

**Outcome**
Learners understand *how backend systems actually work*, not just how to write annotations.

---

### 🏗️ Phase 4: Design Patterns

**Goal**  
Teach architectural thinking through visual metaphors and interactive simulations.

**Covered Patterns**
- Singleton – thread safety and lifecycle
- Factory – object creation abstraction
- Observer – event-driven communication
- Strategy – interchangeable behaviors
- Builder – complex object creation

**Approach**
